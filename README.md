## 🕹️ Hangman Game

**Hangman** is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time.  
Each wrong guess brings the player closer to "hanging" — with a limited number of attempts before the game is lost.

### 🎯 How to Play:
- The game selects a random word.
- The player guesses one letter at a time.
- If the letter is correct, it's revealed in the word.
- If the letter is wrong, a part of the hangman is drawn.
- The game ends when the player guesses the whole word or reaches the max number of wrong guesses.
